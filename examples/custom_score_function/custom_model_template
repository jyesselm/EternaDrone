#Here is the list of all features currently implemented 
###Sequence Features###
#percent_a : number of As / total length of sequence 
#percent_u : number of Us / total length of sequence 
#percent_g : number of Gs / total length of sequence 
#percent_c : number of Cs / total length of sequence 
#max_a_repeat : max stretch of As, ex. AAAUAC => 3
#max_u_repeat : max stretch of Us
#max_g_repeat : max stretch of Gs
#max_c_repeat : max stretch of Cs
###Structure Features###
#percent_au : number of AU basepairs / number of basepairs (given by target secondary structure)
#percent_gc : number of GC basepairs / number of basepairs
#percent_wc : number of Waston-Crick (AU and GC) basepairs / number of basepairs
#percent_nc : number of Nonconical (Not AU and GC)  basepairs / number of basepairs
#n_basepairs : number of basepairs (given by target secondary structure)
#not_capped_loops : inspired by Eli Fisker (Eterna Proplayer), number of bulges/hairpins/junctions that do NOT have a GC pair at their edge
#not_stem_capped : number of stems (basepair stretches) that do not start with a GC pair at the edge 
###Vienna Features###
#avg_structure_diff : number of structures that differ between target structure and vienna predicted structure 
#free_energy: the vienna calculated free energy
#melting_temp: the temperature at which vienna predicts 0 free energy 
#mfe_prob: frequency of mfe structure in ensemble  
#ensemble_diversity: vienna's ensemble diversity parameter 
                       
#Score Function 1
100 - (percent_au - 0.45) * 0.75 + melting_temp
